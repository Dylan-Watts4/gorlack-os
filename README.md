<h1> Gorlack OS </h1>
<p> Gorlack OS is a single-manned, open ended project to design an operating system. The name <b>GorlackOS</b> is derived from someone telling me to call it that, so do excuse it.</p>

<h2>How to run GOS</h2>
<p>Along with the project files, there is a Makefile. All of the compiling is done through this file so all you have to do is run it and it will produce a os-image.bin file.</p>
<p>As I am sure you are aware, there are some prerequisites to running this, they are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>qemu</li>
  <li>nasm</li>
  <li>gmp</li>
  <li>mpfr</li>
  <li>libmpc</li>
  <li>gcc</li>
</ul>
